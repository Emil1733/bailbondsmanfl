## 2. How Bail Bonds Work in Florida

### The Basic Process
1. A person is arrested and transported to a county booking facility.
2. They are booked (photographed, fingerprinted, charged). This takes 2–6 hours.
3. A bond amount is set — either by a pre-set schedule or by a judge at First Appearance Court (held within 24 hours of arrest).
4. A bail bondsman pays the court a surety bond for 10% of the total amount.
5. The defendant is released pending trial. If they skip court, the bondsman owes the full amount.

### Self-Bail vs. Bondsman
- **Self-bail (cash bond):** The defendant or family pays the full bond amount in cash directly to the court. This is refunded after the case concludes (minus fees).
- **Bondsman (surety bond):** The family pays the bondsman 10% as a non-refundable fee. The bondsman guarantees the full amount to the court.

### Transfer Prevention (Core Differentiator)
Florida's multi-tiered jail system means an arrest at a city police department (e.g., Tampa PD) will result in transfer to the county jail hub (e.g., Orient Road Jail) if the inmate is not bonded out first. The transfer adds 4–12 hours of processing time. Posting bond immediately at the city holding facility prevents this transfer and is the fastest release path.

## 3. Specialty Bond Types

### DUI Bail Bonds
- **Mandatory 8-hour sobriety hold:** Florida law requires the defendant remain in custody until their BAC drops below 0.05% or 8 hours pass, whichever comes first. Bond can be signed but release will not occur until this hold expires.
- **Bond range:** First offense DUI: $500–$1,000 bond. Felony DUI (3rd offense within 10 years): $5,000–$10,000.
- **Driver's license:** The license is typically seized at arrest. The DUI citation serves as a 10-day temporary permit.

### Domestic Violence Bail Bonds
- **Mandatory First Appearance:** DV defendants cannot bond out immediately. They must see a judge (usually within 24 hours) before bond is set. The judge issues a No Contact Order at this hearing.
- **No Contact Order:** Prevents the defendant from contacting or returning to the home shared with the alleged victim. Violation is a felony.
- **Process:** Bondsman prepares everything beforehand so release is immediate after the judge's ruling.

### Federal / Immigration Bonds
- **Federal license required:** Immigration (ICE) bonds are distinct from state bonds. A separate federal surety license is required. Bond Florida holds this license.
- **Two types:**
  - *Delivery bond:* Allows the detained person to be released pending their immigration hearing.
  - *Voluntary departure bond:* Allows the person to leave the country voluntarily and forfeit the bond.
- **Key difference:** ICE bonds are set by an immigration judge or ICE officer, not a state court.

### Nebbia Hold
- A Florida-specific court order requiring the defendant to prove that bail funds do not come from illegal proceeds (e.g., drug trafficking).
- Must file financial documentation (pay stubs, bank statements, deed of ownership) before the court will accept the bond.
- Common in drug trafficking, money laundering, and high-profile cases.
- Bond Florida handles all Nebbia documentation preparation.

### Traffic Warrant / Bench Warrant Bonds
- A bench warrant is issued when a defendant fails to appear (FTA) in court or fails to pay a traffic ticket.
- "Walk-through" service: The bondsman accompanies the defendant to the police station, the warrant is cleared, and they leave without entering a cell.
- Common charges: Failure to Appear, Driving While License Suspended (DWLS), unpaid citations.

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions (Master Set)

**Q: What is the cost of a bail bond in Florida?**
A: Florida law sets the premium at exactly 10% of the full bond amount. This is non-negotiable and uniform across all licensed bondsmen in the state.

**Q: How long does release typically take?**
A: Varies by county: Miami-Dade (TGK): 2–4 hours. Broward (Main Jail): 6–12 hours. Hillsborough (Orient Road): 6–10 hours. Orange (BRC, Vision Blvd): 6–10 hours. Palm Beach (Gun Club Rd): 4–8 hours.

**Q: Can a bondsman post bond at night or on weekends?**
A: Yes. Bond Florida operates 24/7/365. All county jails process bonds around the clock. There is no "closed" window.

**Q: What is a Nebbia Hold and how long does it take?**
A: A Nebbia Hold is a court order that pauses any release until financial documentation is filed showing the bail funds are not drug proceeds. The process typically takes 1–3 business days, depending on the documentation and the judge's availability.

**Q: What is the difference between a bondsman and a bail agent?**
A: The terms are interchangeable in Florida. Both refer to a licensed professional who posts surety bail bonds on behalf of a defendant.

**Q: Does using a bail bondsman affect the outcome of the criminal case?**
A: No. The bail bond is a financial guarantee for court appearance only. It has no bearing on how the criminal case is prosecuted or resolved.
